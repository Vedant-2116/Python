The number of layers and hidden units in a neural network really matters for how well it learns from data. Adding more can help understand complex patterns better, improving accuracy, but too many can lead to memorizing useless details, hurting performance. Simplifying by reducing layers or units might make it easier to understand but could also miss important patterns, lowering accuracy.\n","\n","2. Overfitting doesn't always happen, but it's like a bug in machine learning. It occurs when the model gets too fixated on the training data, mistaking noise for important patterns. Simple models are less likely to overfit, while complex ones with lots of parts are more at risk, especially with small datasets.\n","\n","3. Dealing with overfitting involves splitting data into training and validation sets to spot if the model is overfitting, using techniques like regularization to keep it simple, dropout to prevent reliance on certain neurons, early stopping to halt training when performance declines, and sometimes simplifying the model by trimming layers or units to tame overfitting, albeit at the expense of some complexity."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wjl8cvkazc_p"},"source":["#10-b\n","# Please try different sessing as we did in #09\n","# You can change the number of layers, hidden units, compile parameters, number of epochs, batch_size... everything!\n","# Please change one parameter at a time.\n","# And share your experience."],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0oT_gJx4-s_6","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709871359111,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":5437,"user":{"displayName":"Gohel Vedant","userId":"09781426983370340983"}},"outputId":"28a10f3b-163b-4a4e-e0c0-846beb353567"},"source":["# Adjusting the number of hidden units\n","myModel3 = models.Sequential()\n","myModel3.add(layers.Dense(150, activation='relu'))\n","myModel3.add(layers.Dense(150, activation='relu'))\n","myModel3.add(layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax'))\n","\n","# Compiling the model\n","myModel3.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n","\n","# Fitting the model\n","model3 = myModel3.fit(x_train, one_hot_train_labels, epochs=20, batch_size=10)\n","\n","# Evaluating the model\n","test_loss3, test_acc3 = myModel3.evaluate(x_test, one_hot_test_labels)\n","print(\"Test accuracy with increased hidden units:\", test_acc3)\n","\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Epoch 1/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 2s 8ms/step - loss: 0.9117 - accuracy: 0.6083\n","Epoch 2/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 8ms/step - loss: 0.6257 - accuracy: 0.7250\n","Epoch 3/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 7ms/step - loss: 0.4944 - accuracy: 0.7917\n","Epoch 4/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 7ms/step - loss: 0.4260 - accuracy: 0.8333\n","Epoch 5/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 11ms/step - loss: 0.3504 - accuracy: 0.8917\n","Epoch 6/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 9ms/step - loss: 0.3110 - accuracy: 0.9167\n","Epoch 7/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 8ms/step - loss: 0.2638 - accuracy: 0.9250\n","Epoch 8/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 6ms/step - loss: 0.2234 - accuracy: 0.9417\n","Epoch 9/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 7ms/step - loss: 0.1964 - accuracy: 0.9500\n","Epoch 10/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 8ms/step - loss: 0.1760 - accuracy: 0.9500\n","Epoch 11/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 10ms/step - loss: 0.2056 - accuracy: 0.9250\n","Epoch 12/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 9ms/step - loss: 0.1528 - accuracy: 0.9417\n","Epoch 13/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 8ms/step - loss: 0.1631 - accuracy: 0.9500\n","Epoch 14/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 9ms/step - loss: 0.1298 - accuracy: 0.9500\n","Epoch 15/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 8ms/step - loss: 0.1337 - accuracy: 0.9583\n","Epoch 16/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 8ms/step - loss: 0.1231 - accuracy: 0.9667\n","Epoch 17/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 12ms/step - loss: 0.1135 - accuracy: 0.9583\n","Epoch 18/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 11ms/step - loss: 0.0935 - accuracy: 0.9500\n","Epoch 19/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 15ms/step - loss: 0.1303 - accuracy: 0.9417\n","Epoch 20/20\n","12/12 [==============================] - 0s 14ms/step - loss: 0.0996 - accuracy: 0.9667\n","1/1 [==============================] - 1s 617ms/step - loss: 0.3080 - accuracy: 0.8667\n","Test accuracy with increased hidden units: 0.8666666746139526\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"N5b2shyIdhiv"},"source":["---\n","# Deliverables:\n","1.
